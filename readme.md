# Achiever

Achiever is a full-stack web application built with .NET 8 and Blazor WebAssembly. It's designed to showcase the capabilities of minimal APIs and Blazor, two powerful features of the .NET ecosystem.

The solution is structured into four projects:

1. **Api**: This is the backend of the application, built with .NET 8 minimal APIs. It provides a clean, efficient, and flexible way to define the server-side logic of the application.

2. **Client**: This is the frontend of the application, built with Blazor WebAssembly. It provides a rich, interactive user interface that runs in the user's web browser using WebAssembly.

3. **Shared**: This project contains code that is shared between the Api and Client projects. This might include data models, constants, or utility functions.

4. **Test**: This project contains tests for the Api and Client projects. It helps ensure the reliability and correctness of the application's code.

5. **iOS**: This project contains a native SwiftUI iOS app for the Api backend. 

Achiever demonstrates how to build a modern, full-stack web application with .NET and Blazor. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in a full-stack c# app with newer .Net features like Minimal API Endpoints and the latest identity practices with a wasm client.
